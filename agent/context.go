/*
InvocationContext represents the context of an agent invocation.

An invocation:
 1. Starts with a user message and ends with a final response.
 2. Can contain one or multiple agent calls.
 3. Is handled by runner.Run().

An invocation runs an agent until it does not request to transfer to another
agent.

An agent call:
 1. Is handled by agent.Run().
 2. Ends when agent.Run() ends.

An agent call can contain one or multiple steps.
For example, LLM agent runs steps in a loop until:
 1. A final response is generated.
 2. The agent transfers to another agent.
 3. EndInvocation() was called by the invocation context.

A step:
 1. Calls the LLM only once and yields its response.
 2. Calls the tools and yields their responses if requested.

The summarization of the function response is considered another step, since
it is another LLM call.
A step ends when it's done calling LLM and tools, or if the EndInvocation() was
called by invocation context at any time.

	//
	// Example Usage:
	//   if confirmation := ctx.ToolConfirmation(); confirmation == nil {
	//       // Confirmation required, create confirmation or handle appropriately
	//       ctx.RequestConfirmation("hint", payload)
	//   }

	// ask the user for approval before the tool proceeds with a specific
	// action. Call this method when a tool needs explicit user consent.
	//
	// This will typically result in the ADK emitting a special event
	// (e.g., a FunctionCall like "adk_request_confirmation") to the client
	// application/UI, prompting the user for a decision.
	//
	// Args:
	//   - hint: A human-readable string explaining why confirmation is needed.
	//     This is usually displayed to the user in the confirmation prompt.
	//   - payload: Any additional data or context about the action requiring
	//     confirmation.
	//
	// Returns:
	//   - nil: If the confirmation request was successfully enqueued or
	//     initiated within the ADK. This indicates that the process of asking
	//     the user has begun. It does NOT mean the action is approved. The
	//     tool's execution will likely pause or be suspended until the user
	//     responds.
	//   - error: If there was a failure in initiating the confirmation process
	//     itself (e.g., invalid arguments, issue with the event system). The
	//     request to ask the user has not been sent.
